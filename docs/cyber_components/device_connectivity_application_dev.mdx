# Device Connectivity, Client-side and Server-side Application Development using ThingsBoard API

This section explores how to utilize ThingsBoard platform APIs to develop connected applications for IoT devices. It covers various device connectivity options and offers insights into APIs available for managing device attributes, telemetry data, remote procedure calls (RPC), and messaging between devices.

## Device Connectivity Options
ThingsBoard supports a variety of connectivity protocols, providing flexibility to suit different device capabilities and application needs.

#### Review of Supported Network Protocols: MQTT, HTTP, and CoAP
- **MQTT**: A lightweight messaging protocol optimized for low-bandwidth, high-latency, or unreliable networks.
- **HTTP**: A common protocol ideal for devices that do not require real-time connectivity.
- **CoAP**: Designed for simple electronic devices, offering high efficiency in constrained environments.
- For detailed insights, see the [Device Connectivity Options documentation](https://thingsboard.io/docs/getting-started-guides/connectivity/).

## Attributes API
The Attributes API enables devices to store and retrieve configuration and status information, essential for managing device states and configurations.
- **Use Cases**: Ideal for managing device configurations or maintaining stateful information across sessions.
- Further details are available in the [Attributes API guide](https://thingsboard.io/docs/user-guide/attributes/).

## Timeseries API
The Timeseries API is crucial for handling large volumes of time-stamped data from devices, suitable for historical data analysis and real-time monitoring.
- **Use Cases**: Perfect for applications that analyze sensor data over time to identify trends or anomalies.
- More information can be found in the [Timeseries API documentation](https://thingsboard.io/docs/user-guide/telemetry/).

## RPC API
ThingsBoard's RPC API facilitates remote procedure calls, enabling the server to interact directly with devices for both synchronous and asynchronous tasks.
- **Use Cases**: Useful for sending commands to devices and receiving responses in real-time.
- Discover the functionalities of RPC in the [RPC API guide](https://thingsboard.io/docs/user-guide/rpc/).

## Rule Engine
ThingsBoard's Rule Engine allows for complex data processing and action automation based on device data flow.

#### Explain Rule Engine Data Flow
- **Data Flow**: The Rule Engine processes data streams from devices, applying filters, transformations, and actions based on defined rules.
- Learn about the Rule Engine data flow in the [Rule Engine Overview](https://thingsboard.io/docs/user-guide/rule-engine-2-0/overview/).

#### Review Rule Components: Filters, Processors, and Actions
- **Filters**: Determine which data streams trigger rule actions based on specific conditions.
- **Processors and Actions**: Modify data or trigger actions within external systems.
- **Available Implementations**: Includes a variety of nodes such as enrichment, transformation, and external action nodes.
- Deep dive into Rule Components in the [Filters](https://thingsboard.io/docs/user-guide/rule-engine-2-0/filter-nodes/), [Enrichment Nodes](https://thingsboard.io/docs/user-guide/rule-engine-2-0/enrichment-nodes/), [Transformation Nodes](https://thingsboard.io/docs/user-guide/rule-engine-2-0/transformation-nodes/), [Action Nodes](https://thingsboard.io/docs/user-guide/rule-engine-2-0/action-nodes/), [External Nodes](https://thingsboard.io/docs/user-guide/rule-engine-2-0/external-nodes/), and [Flow Nodes documentation](https://thingsboard.io/docs/user-guide/rule-engine-2-0/flow-nodes/).
