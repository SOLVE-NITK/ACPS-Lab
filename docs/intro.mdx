# Introduction to Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS)

At the intersection of the physical world and digital computation lies a transformative technology known as Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS). These systems embody the essence of innovation in modern societies, serving as the backbone of infrastructure and services that are crucial to our daily lives.

CPS are intricate networks where hardware and software components collaborate in real-time to sense, process, and manipulate the environment. From smart grids that manage our energy resources to healthcare devices that monitor patient health, CPS are rapidly becoming fundamental to societal advancement.

The heart of CPS is the seamless integration of sensors that collect data, actuators that effect change, and computational units that analyze and decide based on continuous streams of information. Together, these elements enable systems that can autonomously adjust to new data, learn from past actions, and predict future states, making them smarter and more responsive.
