## Communication Protocols

### Controller Communication

The Raspberry Pi Pico W uses Wi-Fi and MQTT protocols to communicate with the ThingsBoard server, facilitating data exchange necessary for system operation and monitoring.

#### Wi-Fi Connection
The Raspberry Pi Pico W connects to the local Wi-Fi network, providing internet access and enabling seamless interaction with external services such as the ThingsBoard server. This wireless connection is crucial for sending and receiving data in real-time, ensuring that the system remains responsive and connected.

#### MQTT Protocol
MQTT (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport) is a lightweight and efficient messaging protocol designed specifically for devices with limited resources operating in potentially unreliable networks. In this system, MQTT handles the transmission of data such as access events between the Raspberry Pi Pico W and the ThingsBoard server. This protocol supports data publication from the controller to the server and subscriptions to commands or acknowledgements, enhancing the system’s reliability and security for real-time data visualization and monitoring.

### Sensor Communication

The communication between the RC522 RFID module and the Raspberry Pi Pico W controller is facilitated by the Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI) protocol.

#### SPI Protocol
SPI is a synchronous serial communication interface used for short distance communication, primarily in embedded systems. In this setup, the RC522 RFID module uses SPI to transmit the identification data of RFID tags to the Raspberry Pi Pico W controller. The controller sends commands to the RFID module to initiate data transfer, and the module responds with the tag's unique identifier. This identifier is then used by the controller to determine access control decisions. The SPI protocol is chosen for its speed and reliability, ensuring that the RFID data is transferred swiftly and accurately, which is essential for maintaining system integrity and quick response times.
