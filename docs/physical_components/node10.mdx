The 3V relay module is an electronic switch that operates at a low voltage of 3 volts, making it suitable for use in low-power circuits and microcontroller-based projects. It typically consists of a relay, driver circuitry, and input/output connectors. The relay serves as an electromechanical switch, capable of controlling higher voltage and current loads with a low-voltage signal. This module is commonly used to interface microcontrollers, Arduino boards, or other digital devices with appliances, lights, or other electrical loads. It simplifies the process of controlling high-power devices by allowing you to use a low-voltage signal to open or close the relay contacts, thereby turning the connected load on or off.

## Communication Protocols

### Controller Communication

The communication between the Arduino Nano 33 IoT controller and the ThingsBoard server involves two key protocols: Wi-Fi and MQTT.

#### Wi-Fi Connection:
The Arduino Nano 33 IoT connects to a local Wi-Fi network, enabling it to access the internet. This connection provides the foundation for communication with external services like the ThingsBoard server.

#### MQTT Protocol:
The Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT) protocol is employed for transmitting data between the controller and the ThingsBoard server. MQTT is a lightweight and efficient protocol designed for remote devices with limited resources. It facilitates the publication of data (such as access events) from the controller to the server, as well as the subscription to commands or acknowledgements from the server. MQTT ensures secure and reliable communication, making it ideal for real-time data visualization and monitoring on the ThingsBoard dashboard. The controller publishes messages related to access events, which are then visualized on the dashboard, offering insights into the system's performance and access patterns.

### Sensor Communication

The primary sensor used in this node is the LM35 temperature sensor, which communicates with the Arduino Nano 33 IoT controller through analog data.

#### Analog Data Communication (LM35 Temperature Sensor):
The LM35 temperature sensor employs analog data communication to relay precise temperature measurements to the Arduino Nano 33 IoT controller. The sensor generates an analog voltage signal that is directly proportional to the ambient temperature. The controller, equipped with analog-to-digital conversion capabilities, reads this analog signal and interprets it as temperature data. This communication method allows for high precision in temperature measurement and control. When the temperature exceeds predefined thresholds, the controller triggers the relay to activate or deactivate the connected fan, thereby maintaining the desired environmental conditions.
