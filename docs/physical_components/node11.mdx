### Sensor: SW-420 Vibration Sensor

The SW-420 Vibration Sensor is a small and sensitive module designed to detect vibrations and movement. It typically consists of a spring-mounted metal ball inside a metal casing, creating an electrical connection. When subjected to vibrations or shocks, the ball may move and momentarily disrupt this connection, generating an electrical signal. This signal can be detected and processed by a microcontroller or other electronic circuits to detect and respond to vibrations or impacts. The SW-420 Vibration Sensor is commonly used in applications like burglar alarms, vehicle security systems, and industrial equipment to trigger actions in response to physical movement or tampering. Its simplicity and effectiveness make it a valuable component for projects that require motion sensing and security features.

### Actuator: Buzzer

A passive piezoelectric buzzer utilizes a piezoelectric crystal or ceramic element to create sound. When alternating voltage is applied, the piezoelectric element undergoes rapid expansion and contraction, which generates vibrations. These vibrations produce sound waves, creating audible noise. This type of buzzer is commonly used in alarms, timers, and user interface feedback due to its simplicity and effectiveness.

## Communication Protocols

### Controller Communication

The communication between the Raspberry Pi Pico W controller and the ThingsBoard server involves two key protocols: Wi-Fi and MQTT.

#### Wi-Fi Connection:
The Raspberry Pi Pico W connects to a local Wi-Fi network, enabling it to access the internet. This connection provides the foundation for communication with external services like the ThingsBoard server.

#### MQTT Protocol:
The Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT) protocol is employed for transmitting data between the controller and the ThingsBoard server. MQTT is a lightweight and efficient protocol designed for remote devices with limited resources. It facilitates the publication of data (such as access events) from the controller to the server, as well as the subscription to commands or acknowledgements from the server. MQTT ensures secure and reliable communication, making it ideal for real-time data visualization and monitoring on the ThingsBoard dashboard. The controller publishes messages related to access events, which are then visualized on the dashboard, offering insights into the system's performance and access patterns.

### ensor Communication

The communication between the SW-420 vibration sensor and the Raspberry Pi Pico W controller is accomplished through digital data.

#### Digital Data Communication:
The SW-420 vibration sensor is designed to provide digital output. It communicates with the controller by generating a digital signal based on the presence or absence of vibrations or shocks. When a vibration or shock is detected, the sensor produces a digital signal that the controller can readily interpret. This digital signal serves as an input to the controller's GPIO pins, allowing it to react promptly to detected events. This digital communication method ensures the swift and accurate detection of vibrations and shocks, making it suitable for the node's purpose.
