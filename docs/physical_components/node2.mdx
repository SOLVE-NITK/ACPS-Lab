## Communication Protocols

### Controller Communication

#### Wi-Fi Connection
The Teensy 4.1 microcontroller in Node 2 utilizes a Wi-Fi connection to establish internet access, which is critical for its interaction with external services such as the ThingsBoard server. This connection enables the microcontroller to send and receive data in real-time, forming the backbone of the system's data management and transmission capabilities.

#### MQTT Protocol
Node 2 employs the Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT) protocol for efficient and reliable data transmission between the Teensy 4.1 microcontroller and the ThingsBoard server. MQTT, known for its lightweight and low-bandwidth consumption, is particularly well-suited for devices with limited resources. It supports data publication and subscription mechanisms, allowing the controller to publish access events and receive commands or acknowledgments. This setup ensures secure and real-time communication, facilitating data visualization and monitoring on the ThingsBoard dashboard, thus providing valuable insights into system performance and user interactions.

### Sensor Communication

#### I2C Protocol
The MLX90614 Non-Contact IR Temperature Sensor communicates with the Teensy 4.1 microcontroller via the I2C (Inter-Integrated Circuit) protocol, a high-speed, bidirectional serial communication protocol used widely in microcontroller applications. In Node 2, the I2C protocol is crucial for transmitting temperature data from the MLX90614 sensor to the microcontroller. The process begins with the controller sending commands to the sensor, which then responds by sending back temperature data, leveraging the efficiency of I2C to ensure rapid and accurate data transfer. This protocol is vital for the node’s capability to deliver real-time and precise temperature measurements, enhancing the node’s functionality in various applications, from medical devices to environmental monitoring.
