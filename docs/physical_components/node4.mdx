## Communication Protocols

### Controller Communication

The Arduino MKR 1010 utilizes two primary communication protocols to interface with the ThingsBoard server: Wi-Fi and MQTT.

#### Wi-Fi Connection
The Arduino MKR 1010 establishes a connection to a local Wi-Fi network, granting it internet access. This connectivity is crucial as it forms the backbone for interactions with external services, including the ThingsBoard server, facilitating seamless data exchange and system operations.

#### MQTT Protocol
MQTT (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport) is a lightweight and efficient messaging protocol designed specifically for small sensors and mobile devices with limited processing power and minimal network bandwidth. In this setup, the Arduino MKR 1010 uses MQTT to publish data to the ThingsBoard server and subscribe to commands or acknowledgments, ensuring secure and reliable communication. This protocol is instrumental in enabling real-time data visualization and monitoring on the ThingsBoard dashboard.

### Sensor Communication

#### Flame Sensor (Infrared-Based)
The communication between the infrared-based flame sensor and the Arduino MKR 1010 is managed through digital signal pathways. The flame sensor emits a digital signal to the controller upon detecting fire or flames, triggering the alarm system. This digital communication ensures quick and precise responses, crucial for immediate action in fire-related events.

#### Gas/Smoke Sensor (MQ2)
Communication between the MQ2 gas/smoke sensor and the Arduino MKR 1010 is conducted via analog signal pathways. The MQ2 sensor uses analog signals to convey the concentration of various flammable gases or smoke detected in the environment. These analog signals allow for detailed and accurate assessments of potential hazards, enabling the controller to initiate appropriate safety measures effectively.

The integration of both digital and analog communication methods significantly enhances the system's capability to detect and respond to various hazards with increased accuracy and efficiency.
