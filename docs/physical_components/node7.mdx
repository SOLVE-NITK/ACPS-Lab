## Communication Protocols

### Controller Communication

The communication between the ESP8266 controller and the ThingsBoard server involves two key protocols: Wi-Fi and MQTT.

#### Wi-Fi Connection:
The ESP8266 connects to a local Wi-Fi network, enabling it to access the internet. This connection provides the foundation for communication with external services like the ThingsBoard server.

#### MQTT Protocol:
The Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT) protocol is employed for transmitting data between the controller and the ThingsBoard server. MQTT is a lightweight and efficient protocol designed for remote devices with limited resources. It facilitates the publication of data (such as access events) from the controller to the server, as well as the subscription to commands or acknowledgements from the server. MQTT ensures secure and reliable communication, making it ideal for real-time data visualization and monitoring on the ThingsBoard dashboard. The controller publishes messages related to access events, which are then visualized on the dashboard, offering insights into the system's performance and access patterns.

### Sensor Communication

In the node, the PIR sensor communicates with the ESP8266 development board controller through digital signal pathways. When motion is detected, the PIR sensor sends a digital signal to the controller, indicating the presence of motion.
