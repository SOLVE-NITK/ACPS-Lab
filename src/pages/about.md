# Team

Our team is driven by a passion for enhancing the integration of computational intelligence with physical processes. We focus on developing and demonstrating essential ACPS concepts through a comprehensive lab-scale framework. This framework serves as both a pedagogical tool and a practical platform, enabling immersive learning and fostering innovation in the realm of cyber-physical systems.
